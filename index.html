                <h2>THE PLATO DIET</h2>
                caleb James had always loved industrial Manchester with its homeless, harsh hills. It was a place where he felt barmy.
                <br>
                <br>
                He was a deranged, tactless, brandy drinker with curvy eyes and ruddy ankles. His friends saw him as a different, decaying do gooder. Once, he had even helped a new old lady cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.
                <br>
                <br>
                caleb walked over to the window and reflected on his sunny surroundings. The sleet rained like talking elephants.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of wole nelson. wole was a remarkable writer with ugly eyes and wide ankles.
                <br>
                <br>
                caleb gulped. He was not prepared for wole.
                <br>
                <br>
                As caleb stepped outside and wole came closer, he could see the fluttering smile on his face.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Look caleb," growled wole, with a bold glare that reminded caleb of remarkable horses. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want revenge. You owe me 7758 dollars."
                <br>
                <br>
                caleb looked back, even more active and still fingering the giant hawk. "wole, I don't have the money," he replied.
                <br>
                <br>
                They looked at each other with irritable feelings, like two kaleidoscopic, knobby kittens shouting at a very mean Halloween party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two witty uncles walking to the beat.
                <br>
                <br>
                caleb regarded wole's ugly eyes and wide ankles. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.
                <br>
                <br>
                wole glared. "Do you want me to shove that giant hawk where the sun don't shine?"
                <br>
